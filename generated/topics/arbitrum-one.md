## Arbitrum One
 
## What is Arbitrum One ?
Arbitrum One is a Layer 2 optimistic rollup solution developed by Offchain Labs, designed to enhance Ethereum's performance and user experience by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1). It operates on the Arbitrum Rollup protocol and settles to Ethereum's Layer 1, offering high-performance dApps with lower transaction costs and Ethereum-level security without additional trust assumptions. Powered by the Nitro technology stack, Arbitrum One boasts advanced features like calldata compression, separate contexts for execution and fault proving, and Ethereum L1 gas compatibility. Its multi-round interactive Optimistic Rollup approach optimistically assumes the correctness of data posted to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing challenges and efficient dispute resolution at low costs, while maintaining trustless protocol operation, EVM compatibility, and secure fund control for users.

## What is Arbitrum roll up protocol?
The Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is a Layer 2 scaling solution that works in tandem with Ethereum's Layer 1, where it doesn't decide the outcomes of transactions but instead confirms the results that are already determined by the sequence of messages in the chain's inbox. Once a transaction is included in the chainâ€™s inbox, its outcome is considered finalized and can be reported as complete. Arbitrum nodes validate these transactions, providing users the confidence that their transactions are processed without the need for constant awareness of the rollup protocol's operation.

### Benefits of Roll up Protocol
The purpose of the Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is twofold.
 
#### Confirms Accuracy
Firstly, it serves as a trustless method to verify transaction results and to identify and penalize dishonest parties. This is crucial because although the outcomes of transactions are known, without the protocol, there would be no way to confirm their accuracy and resolve disputes definitively.

#### Ethereum Scalability
Secondly, it relieves Ethereum from the burden of processing every transaction, thereby allowing for scalable operations that Ethereum alone could not efficiently monitor. By only stepping in when a transaction is contested, Ethereum can ensure the integrity of the Arbitrum chain while enabling fast and cost-effective Layer 2 transactions. This not only enhances the scalability of Ethereum but also maintains its security by enabling the confirmation of transactions and the processing of withdrawals back to Layer 1.
