## Arbitrum Nitro
 
## What is Arbitrum Nitro?

Arbitrum Nitro is a significant technical upgrade for Arbitrum, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to lower transaction fees and increase the processing capacity of Ethereum by moving contract computation and storage from the primary chain. This upgrade, known as Nitro, is designed to be more compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides a better user experience with lower fees and faster transactions. With Nitro, Arbitrum aims to push the boundaries of security, efficiency, and scalability, offering a promising solution for the future of Ethereum.

It introduces advanced calldata compression, reducing transaction costs even further. Nitro enhances the performance of Layer 1 (L1) nodes, aligns EVM operation pricing with Ethereum, and introduces additional synchronization with Ethereum L1 blocks. As it seamlessly supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), no hefty modifications are required. With Nitro, transactions on Arbitrum have become extremely efficient. 

## Innovative Features of Arbitrum Nitro

#### WebAssembly Code

Nitro introduces a new prover that uses WebAssembly (WASM) code to perform Arbitrum's interactive fraud proofs. This upgrade enhances the scalability and efficiency of the system, allowing for thousands of transactions to be processed per second. Despite being a separate blockchain, Arbitrum Nitro maintains the security and privacy features of Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) and relays all transaction information to the main Ethereum chain.

#### EVM Compatiblility

Developers can easily integrate Arbitrum Nitro without making any modifications because it supports the EVM. This means that existing Ethereum contracts and transactions can run on Arbitrum without any changes. This distinguishes Arbitrum Nitro from other layer 2 solutions as each have their own VMs thereby requiring modifications for integration. 

#### Deterministic Transactions

To use Arbitrum Nitro, users need to submit their transactions to the chain's inbox. The chain will then execute the transaction and produce outputs, including a transaction receipt and any initiated withdrawals. The execution of transactions is deterministic, meaning that the result is known as soon as the transaction is placed in the inbox. Arbitrum ensures the correctness of the chain state and outputs, supports Ethereum-compatible contracts and transactions, and manages the transfer and management of ETH and tokens on the chain.
