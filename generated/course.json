      "details": "## What is Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum blockchain's scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions separately from Ethereum's main chain and utilizes Rollup technology to combine multiple transactions into one, increasing throughput and reducing costs. Arbitrum maintains compatibility with Ethereum's existing tools and smart contracts, allowing for straightforward application deployment. Developed by Offchain Labs, it includes the Arbitrum One mainnet, which supports smart contract execution with Ethereum network validation. The use of Arbitrum significantly lowers transaction fees, making it a cost-effective alternative for running decentralized applications and smart contracts compared to Ethereum's mainnet.\n\n## What is Layer 2 \n\nLayer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system, known as Layer 1. The primary purpose of Layer 2 solutions is to address the scalability and performance issues of the main blockchain by handling transactions off the main chain. This allows for faster processing times and reduced transaction costs, without compromising the decentralized security model of the underlying blockchain. Layer 2 solutions include various technologies such as state channels, sidechains, and rollups, each with their own approach to off-chain transaction handling and subsequently settling the final state on-chain.\n\n## Benefits of Layer 2\n\n1. **Increased Transaction:** Throughput By handling transactions off the main chain, Layer 2 can process many more transactions per second than the base layer, alleviating congestion.\n\n2. **Reduced Costs:** Transactions on Layer 2 typically incur lower fees because they minimize the demand on the network's main chain resources.\n\n3. **Improved Speed:** Transactions can be completed faster on Layer 2, as they are not subject to the longer processing times of the main chain.\n\n4. **Enhanced Scalability:** Layer 2 can scale independently from the main chain, allowing the network to support more users and applications without a proportional increase in transaction costs or times.\n\n5. **Maintained Security:** Despite processing transactions off-chain, Layer 2 solutions typically inherit the strong security guarantees of the underlying main chain.\n\n",

          "shortTitle": "Optimistic Rollup",
          "details": "## Roll Ups\nRollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (off-chain) but record transaction data on the main chain (on-chain). The core idea is to \"roll up\" or batch many transactions into a single one, which is then posted to the main chain. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed on the main chain, significantly increasing throughput and reducing transaction fees.\n\n### Types of Roll ups\nThere are two main types of rollups, each with its own approach to validating the batched transactions:\n\n#### Optimistic Rollups\nThese operate on the principle that all transactions are assumed to be valid by default. They only execute transaction computations on-chain in the event of a challenge. This means that instead of performing computation to prove the correctness of transactions upfront, Optimistic Rollups post the transactions along with a bond. After a challenge period, if no one disputes the transaction batch with a \"fraud proof\" showing that something was wrong, the transactions are considered valid. This method allows for significant scaling benefits, but the challenge period can introduce a delay in finalizing transactions.\n\n#### Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)\nZK-Rollups bundle transactions and generate a cryptographic proof, known as a zero-knowledge proof (specifically, a zk-SNARK or zk-STARK), attesting to their validity. This proof is then posted to the main chain, where it can be quickly verified. Because the validity of the entire batch can be confirmed without executing the transactions individually, ZK-Rollups can finalize transactions much more quickly than Optimistic Rollups. Additionally, ZK-Rollups enhance privacy since the actual transaction data can be kept off-chain.\n\n## Optimistic Rollup; How it works?\nOptimistic Rollups operates on the assumption that all transactions are honest and valid unless proven otherwise. Here's how they work:\n\n#### Step 1: Execution and Aggregation\nIn optimistic rollups, operators, or validators, process transactions by aggregating and compressing them before submitting them to Ethereum's blockchain. Any user can act as a validator by providing a bond, similar to proof-of-stake systems, and risks penalties for any invalid submissions. Validators also maintain their version of the rollup's state and can issue fraud proofs if discrepancies arise. Some rollups use a 'sequencer' instead of multiple validators, which centralizes transaction processing and submission but provides greater control over transaction order and immediate access to the rollup chain.\n\n#### Step 2: Sending Roll up Blocks to Ethereum\nOperators consolidate multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch and compress the transaction data to minimize storage costs on Ethereum. This batch is then submitted to Ethereum as 'calldata' — a temporary and immutable form of data used by smart contracts to execute functions. While 'calldata' remains in the blockchain's history, it does not become part of the Ethereum state, thereby conserving space and reducing costs. The 'calldata' keyword in Solidity is instrumental in calling smart contract functions and organizing inputs, playing a critical role in the efficient operation of optimistic rollups. \n\n#### Step 3: State Commitments\nState commitments play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the system. The state is structured as a Merkle tree, also known as the state tree, which contains all the information about the current state of the rollup. Operators compute new state roots reflecting the latest state changes and submit these roots to the rollup contract on Ethereum. By committing to the old and new state roots when posting transaction batches, and including the Merkle root for transactions, operators provide a verifiable record of the rollup's state changes on the Layer 1 blockchain. This mechanism ensures that the state of the rollup can be trusted and verified.\n\n#### Step 4: Fraud Proof \nThe essence of optimistic rollups lies in their fraud-proof mechanism. They allow blocks to be published without immediate validity checks. If discrepancies are suspected, users can challenge transitions within a set timeframe. Challenges trigger fraud-proof calculations, where disputed transactions are replayed on Ethereum's main network through a verifier contract. If fraud is confirmed, the responsible validator is penalized. To support this, rollups must make detailed state commitments and transaction data public on-chain, which incurs gas fees. Multi-round interactive proofs can enhance this process's efficiency by reducing the data and computation required for each verification step.\n\n#### Step 5: Multiround Interactive Proving\nMulti-round interactive proving is a critical component of optimistic rollups. It involves a dialogue between a challenger and the block's producer (asserter/operator), overseen by a Layer 1 verifier contract. If a block is challenged, the operator splits the disputed assertion for the rollup block into two, with each part undergoing repeated division through a bisection protocol until the specific point of contention is isolated. The verifier contract then adjudicates the dispute and identifies any fraudulent activity. This process ensures that only valid transactions are finalized, with the capability to penalize malicious actors, thereby maintaining the integrity of the rollup.  ",

          "details": "Arbitrum ecosystem consists of various chains with distinct features that utilise unique technologies that enable ethereum scalability. The major arbitrum chains include.\n\n### Arbitrum One\nArbitrum One is a Layer 2 optimistic rollup solution that enhances Ethereum blockchain. It doesn't require any additional trust beyond that which is inherent to Ethereum's Layer 1. Enabled by the Nitro technology stack, Arbitrum One features efficient data handling and execution, improved transaction compression, and compatibility with Ethereum's gas system, streamlining the process while keeping security tight.\n\n### Arbitrum Nova\nArbitrum Nova is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed for high performance and cost efficiency. It operates on the AnyTrust protocol, which is a slightly less trustless system compared to Arbitrum One's Rollup protocol. The primary distinction lies in the AnyTrust protocol's reliance on a Data Availability Committee (DAC) to manage transaction data. This committee ensures the speedy and efficient handling of Level 2 transaction data before it is finalized on Ethereum's main chain. Arbitrum Nova is tailored for applications where high throughput and affordability are prioritized.\n\n### Arbitrum Orbit\nArbitrum Orbit allows the creation of personalized chains that settle transactions to Arbitrum's Layer 2 chains, such as Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. You have full control over your Orbit chain, with the ability to tailor its privacy settings, permissions, governance structure, and fee token according to your specific requirements. Orbit chains can be as open or restricted as you prefer, offering a customizable path to decentralization and the option to integrate ongoing enhancements from the Arbitrum Nitro technology stack\n\n## How is arbiturm diferent from other Optimistic L2 Rollups?\nArbitrum's approach prioritizes a balance of speed, cost, security, and developer accessibility, underpinning its leading market position. Some of the major differences include:\n\n### Fraud Proofs\nArbitrum sets itself apart from other Optimistic L2 Rollups primarily through its multi-round fraud proof system, which contrasts with single-round fraud proofs used by platforms like Optimism. This system verifies only challenged transactions, which may result in lower fees due to decreased reliance on Layer 1 computations.\n\n### Virtual Machine Compatibility\nThe Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM) is more closely optimized for EVM coding languages, making it developer-friendly as applications don't need to be rewritten to transition from the EVM to the AVM. This contrasts with Optimism's Virtual Machine (OVM), which has faced some compatibility issues with the EVM.\n\n### Transaction Finality and Fees\nDue to the multi-round fraud proof mechanism, transaction finality on Arbitrum can be slower compared to some other rollups, but this trade-off allows for lower fees because of reduced Layer 1 computation reliance​.",

For Arbitrum Nova, there's also a Data Availability Committee tasked with data storage and availability. The governance system has the power to modify validators and Sequencers, who are responsible for transaction ordering, thereby maintaining a balance between central oversight and progressive decentralization. This governance framework is designed to evolve, with the potential for changes based on community feedback, reflecting the adaptive nature of the protocol's management.\n\nProgressive decentralization is a strategic approach to building trust and stability within a blockchain ecosystem. It starts with a centralized authority, such as the core development team, who can quickly respond to issues and update the system efficiently. Over time, control is handed over to a broader set of stakeholders, which enhances security by reducing central points of failure. It also deepens community involvement, as more participants are empowered to govern the network, which in turn fosters a more resilient and democratic infrastructure. This gradual transition allows the network to maintain continuity and stability while progressively mitigating risks and adapting to a decentralized governance structure.",

      "details": "## What is Arbitrum Nitro?\n\nArbitrum Nitro is a significant technical upgrade for Arbitrum, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to lower transaction fees and increase the processing capacity of Ethereum by moving contract computation and storage from the primary chain. This upgrade, known as Nitro, is designed to be more compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides a better user experience with lower fees and faster transactions. With Nitro, Arbitrum aims to push the boundaries of security, efficiency, and scalability, offering a promising solution for the future of Ethereum. \n\nIt introduces advanced calldata compression, reducing transaction costs even further. Nitro enhances the performance of Layer 1 (L1) nodes, aligns EVM operation pricing with Ethereum, and introduces additional synchronization with Ethereum L1 blocks. As it seamlessly supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), no hefty modifications are required. With Nitro, transactions on Arbitrum have become extremely efficient. \n\n## Innovative Features of Arbitrum Nitro\n\n#### WebAssembly Code\n\nNitro introduces a new prover that uses WebAssembly (WASM) code to perform Arbitrum's interactive fraud proofs. This upgrade enhances the scalability and efficiency of the system, allowing for thousands of transactions to be processed per second. Despite being a separate blockchain, Arbitrum Nitro maintains the security and privacy features of Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) and relays all transaction information to the main Ethereum chain.\n\n#### EVM Compatiblility\n\nDevelopers can easily integrate Arbitrum Nitro without making any modifications because it supports the EVM. This means that existing Ethereum contracts and transactions can run on Arbitrum without any changes. This distinguishes Arbitrum Nitro from other layer 2 solutions as each have their own VMs thereby requiring modifications for integration. \n\n#### Deterministic Transactions\n\nTo use Arbitrum Nitro, users need to submit their transactions to the chain's inbox. The chain will then execute the transaction and produce outputs, including a transaction receipt and any initiated withdrawals. The execution of transactions is deterministic, meaning that the result is known as soon as the transaction is placed in the inbox. Arbitrum ensures the correctness of the chain state and outputs, supports Ethereum-compatible contracts and transactions, and manages the transfer and management of ETH and tokens on the chain. ",

          "shortTitle": "Architecture",
          "details": "## How Transactions Work?\n\nDesigned to enhance efficiency and streamline workflows, the Nitro design emerges as an evidence to innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem. The transaction pocess in Arbitrum Nitro technology consists of the following cricial steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Sequencing and Deterministic Execution\n\nWhen a user sends a transaction on the Nitro chain, it is signed with their wallet and given to the Sequencer. The Sequencer orders transactions and publishes them, after which they're processed to update the Nitro chain state, producing Layer 2 blocks as needed. Invalid transactions are rejected to keep the sequence authentic. The Sequencer uses a real-time alert system for immediate soft finality and batches transactions on the Ethereum chain for hard finality. The latter involves compressing transactions using \"brotli\" and posting them to Ethereum, where their finalization ensures the sequence's immutability on Nitro.\n\n#### Step 2: State Transition Function\n\nIn Arbitrum Nitro's transaction lifecycle, the State Transition Function (STF) is crucial for updating the blockchain's state. Once a transaction is submitted, it enters the Nitro system either through a Sequencer or directly into the inbox. The STF then processes these transactions, taking the current state and the transaction data to compute a new state. It performs all the necessary calculations and state alterations in a deterministic manner, such as adjusting account balances and modifying smart contract states. This transition is then reflected on the chain, with the STF ensuring that the state progresses correctly and consistently after each transaction, maintaining the integrity and continuity of the blockchain's ledger.\n\n#### Step 3: Posting on Layer 1\n\nIn Arbitrum Nitro's transaction lifecycle, data posting on Layer 1 is where transaction inputs are recorded as calldata on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for full transparency and enabling anyone to reconstruct the chain's state. This process supports the network's optimistic rollup approach, where validators post proposed rollup blocks to Layer 1, which are assumed correct unless challenged within a roughly one-week period. If unchallenged, the block is confirmed, but disputed blocks trigger Arbitrum's dispute resolution protocol to determine accuracy, penalizing dishonest validators with deposit forfeiture. This design ensures the integrity of posted data while minimizing fraud.\n\n## Nitro Under the Hood\n\nArbitrum Nitro's innovative architecture is designed to streamline both the execution of smart contracts and the verification process in case of disputes. Central to this architecture is the implementation of \"geth at the core,\" which utilizes go-ethereum, the commonly used Ethereum node software, written in the Go programming language. This foundational approach is manifested in a layered structure. Nitro harnesses the power of this setup to optimise performance while maintaining the robustness of security and verification processes.\n\n### Layers of Nitro Node\n\nNitro utilizes the same source code for two distinct tasks: execution and proving, by employing \"geth at the core.\" The Nitro node software, predominantly written in Go like go-ethereum (geth), consists of three main layers—the base layer with core geth functionalities, the middle layer called ArbOS providing Layer 2 features, and the top layer handling node operations, also derived from geth. This layered design forms the \"geth sandwich,\" with geth as the bread and ArbOS as the filling.\n\n### Dual Compilation Strategy\n\nFor execution, the source code is compiled into native code using the standard Go compiler, customized for the specific architecture of the node deployment. In contrast, for proving—particularly important when disputes arise—the same source code, especially the State Transition Function (STF), is compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), a portable machine code format. This WASM code is then transformed into WAVM, a modified version for proof procedures. When a dispute occurs, the verification of the STF's results is conducted with reference to the WAVM code, ensuring that the same logic governs both normal operation and the verification process during disputes.",

It operates on the Arbitrum Rollup protocol and settles to Ethereum's Layer 1, offering high-performance dApps with lower transaction costs and Ethereum-level security without additional trust assumptions. Powered by the Nitro technology stack, Arbitrum One boasts advanced features like calldata compression, separate contexts for execution and fault proving, and Ethereum L1 gas compatibility. Its multi-round interactive Optimistic Rollup approach optimistically assumes the correctness of data posted to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing challenges and efficient dispute resolution at low costs, while maintaining trustless protocol operation, EVM compatibility, and secure fund control for users.\n\n## What is Arbitrum roll up protocol?\nThe Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is a Layer 2 scaling solution that works in tandem with Ethereum's Layer 1, where it doesn't decide the outcomes of transactions but instead confirms the results that are already determined by the sequence of messages in the chain's inbox. Once a transaction is included in the chain’s inbox, its outcome is considered finalized and can be reported as complete. Arbitrum nodes validate these transactions, providing users the confidence that their transactions are processed without the need for constant awareness of the rollup protocol's operation.\n\n### Benefits of Roll up Protocol\nThe purpose of the Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is twofold.\n \n#### Confirms Accuracy\nFirstly, it serves as a trustless method to verify transaction results and to identify and penalize dishonest parties. This is crucial because although the outcomes of transactions are known, without the protocol, there would be no way to confirm their accuracy and resolve disputes definitively. \n\n#### Ethereum Scalability\nSecondly, it relieves Ethereum from the burden of processing every transaction, thereby allowing for scalable operations that Ethereum alone could not efficiently monitor. By only stepping in when a transaction is contested, Ethereum can ensure the integrity of the Arbitrum chain while enabling fast and cost-effective Layer 2 transactions. This not only enhances the scalability of Ethereum but also maintains its security by enabling the confirmation of transactions and the processing of withdrawals back to Layer 1.",

          "details": "## How does Arbitrum Rollup Work?\n\n### RBlocks\nAn RBlock within the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is a specialized type of block that encapsulates the state and progress of the Layer 2 (L2) Arbitrum network. Unlike traditional Ethereum Layer 1 blocks or the typical blocks you might find in other Layer 2 solutions, RBlocks serve a unique purpose in the Arbitrum ecosystem. They are part of a separate chain that the Arbitrum rollup protocol manages, effectively acting as checkpoints or snapshots of the L2 state at various points in time.\n\nAn RBlock in the Arbitrum Rollup chain carries its identifier, the number of the last correct RBlock, the total of L2 blocks made, inbox messages used, and a hash of the chain's outputs. These except the RBlock's number are the proposer's unverified claims, which the protocol must confirm or reject. An RBlock also implies the correctness of all preceding RBlocks back to the origin and contests the validity of any direct older RBlocks. Validators can challenge an RBlock before a deadline by proposing an alternative, which could lead to a staked conflict resolution. Here is a step-by-step guide on how the rollup chain works to confirm the rBlocks\n\n### Step 1: RBlocks Creation\nValidators propose RBlocks, which form a chain managed by the Arbitrum rollup protocol, distinct from Ethereum's Layer 1 and Nitro's Layer 2 blocks. When first proposed, RBlocks are 'unresolved' meaning their status as either confirmed or rejected has not yet been determined. Over time, each RBlock is resolved. Confirmed RBlocks become part of the chain's permanent history.\n\n### Step 2: Chain History and Progress\nConfirmed RBlocks are fully accepted and recorded by Ethereum's Layer 1 contracts. The most recent confirmed RBlock is known as the \"latest confirmed RBlock\". Newer RBlocks are proposed and remain unconfirmed until their resolution deadlines pass. The earliest of these is the \"first unresolved RBlock\".\n\n### Step 3: Building on Proposed RBlocks\nValidators can propose new RBlocks based on the latest proposed (but not yet confirmed) RBlock, enabling the chain to grow continuously without waiting for each RBlock's confirmation. Typically, proposed RBlocks are valid and thus are eventually confirmed.\n\n### Step 4: Dealing with Malicious Validators\nIn cases where validators act maliciously by proposing incorrect RBlocks, the protocol can handle a variety of conflict scenarios such as a confirmed RBlock is fully accepted, a rejected RBlock is discarded for being incorrect. Subsequent RBlocks can be rejected due to incorrect claims or because they build on other rejected RBlocks. Unresolved RBlocks are awaiting confirmation or rejection. If they are built on a rejected RBlock, they will also be rejected.\n\n### Step 5: Resolving Conflicts\nConflicts between RBlocks which claim the same predecessor, will be resolved by the protocol, with at least one being rejected. The protocol resolves RBlocks in numerical order. If an RBlock is rejected, any subsequent RBlocks depending on it are automatically rejected.\n\n### Step 6: Security Assurance\nDespite potential conflicts, the security property of the rollup protocol ensures that even if multiple parties act dishonestly, the correct chain execution will be confirmed, safeguarding the integrity of the rollup chain. Validators may stake ETH as a bond for proposing RBlocks. If they propose a wrong RBlock, they will lose their stake, incentivizing honest behavior.",

By utilizing a unique combination of on-chain data availability and off-chain computation, it ensures that even if all but one validator acts maliciously, the integrity of transactions is preserved. Moreover, the interactive dispute resolution process allows any honest participant to challenge incorrect claims by staking, thereby maintaining the overall security and reliability of the network. \n\n### Validators\nValidators are essential participants in the Arbitrum Rollup protocol, responsible for proposing and ensuring the accuracy of RBlocks in the network. Some validators, known as stakers, back their commitments with an ETH deposit, which they lose if found cheating. In most cases, only one staker is active to validate the current state unless disputes arise. While the role is intended to be open to all, Arbitrum One currently uses an allowlist for validators. Any honest validator is empowered to enforce the correct processing of transactions, maintaining the chain's trustlessness and security.\n\n## Staking\nStaking the process of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a network. Participants lock or hold their tokens in a wallet to perform various network functions such as validating transactions, maintaining security, and governance. Here's a step-by-step process of staking within the Arbitrum network:\n\n### Step 1: Stake Deposit\nValidators who choose to become stakers deposit ETH into Arbitrum Layer 1 contracts. These deposits are held as collateral and are at risk if the staker is involved in a losing challenge. A single stake can cover a chain of RBlocks. Stakers are automatically staked on the latest confirmed RBlock and may also opt to stake on a successor to that RBlock, committing to a sequence that represents a single, coherent claim about the chain's history. \n\n### Step 2: Staking Conditions\nValidators not currently staked can place a stake on the latest confirmed RBlock by depositing the minimum stake amount. Validators already staked on an RBlock can extend their stake to one successor of that RBlock without additional deposits. Creating a new RBlock as a successor to an RBlock you're staked on is considered an extension of your stake.  If a validator is staked only on the latest confirmed RBlock, they (or anyone else) can request a refund of their stake.\n\n### Step 3: Creating New RBlocks\nTo propose a new RBlock, a validator must be a staker and have an active stake on the RBlock's predecessor. This requirement ensures validators have a vested interest in the accuracy of their proposed RBlocks. The protocol tracks the required stake amount, which typically matches the base stake amount set by the Nitro chain. If the chain is progressing slowly in confirming RBlocks, the required stake amount may temporarily increase.\n\n### Step 4: Commitment and Resolution\nOnce staked on an RBlock, a validator cannot unstake. The stake is either returned following the confirmation of all RBlocks they're staked on, or lost if the staked RBlock is rejected. Losing a challenge results in the removal of the stake from all RBlocks and forfeiture of the staked funds. The minimum stake amount can increase exponentially based on the time elapsed since the deadline of the first unresolved RBlock, to discourage stalling tactics. As the chain resumes normal progress, the stake requirement decreases.\n\nThis staking mechanism is designed to align the validators' financial incentives with the integrity and efficient progression of the Arbitrum chain.",

          "details": "## Dispute Resolution\nThe dispute resolution process in Arbitrum, which utilizes interactive proving, unfolds as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Initiation of Dispute\nThe claiment makes a claim about the result of the chain's computation. The other person challenges their claim, disagreeing with the result they propose. Both parties engage in a back-and-forth communication, overseen by an L1 contract, aiming to resolve their dispute.\n\n### Step 2: Dissection of Dispute\nThe claiment split their original claim, which covers N execution steps, into two separate claims, each representing N/2 steps. Other party then selects one of these N/2-step claims to contest, effectively reducing the dispute's scope by half. The process of halving the dispute continues, with each iteration focusing on an increasingly smaller portion of the execution steps. This iterative process is repeated until the dispute is narrowed down to a disagreement about a single step of execution.\n\n### Step 3: L1 Contract's Role\nDuring the iterative halving process, the L1 contract does not evaluate the merits of the execution; it only ensures that the protocol's rules are followed. Only when the dispute is about a single step does the L1 contract evaluate the execution to determine the correctness of the claim.\n\n### Step 4: Resolution\nBoth parties are encouraged to perform as much of the dispute resolution work off-chain as possible, minimizing the load on the L1 contract. Once the dispute is reduced to a single step, the L1 contract examines the specific instruction in question to resolve the dispute, determining whether claiment's claim is correct.\n\n## Rules to confirm or reject\nThe first unresolved RBlock can be confirmed if:\n\n- The RBlock's predecessor is the latest confirmed RBlock, and\n\n- The RBlock's deadline has passed, and\n\n- There is at least one staker, and\n\n- All stakers are staked on the RBlock.\n\nThe first unresolved RBlock can be rejected if:\n\n- The RBlock's predecessor has been rejected, or\n\n- All of the following are true:\n\n   The RBlock's deadline has passed, and\n\n   There is at least one staker, and\n\n   No staker is staked on the RBlock.",

      "details": "## What is Arbitrum Nova?\nArbitrum Nova is a variant within the Arbitrum ecosystem that provides a high-performance blockchain solution. Arbitrum Nova operates on the AnyTrust protocol, which is mostly trustless but introduces a new element of trust. The core of this additional trust assumption is the Data Availability Committee (DAC), which has the task of efficiently handling Layer 2 transaction data—storing it, batching it, and then posting it to Ethereum's Layer 1. The presence of the DAC in the AnyTrust protocol is what allows Arbitrum Nova to offer enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for use cases where these attributes are prioritized. \n\n## What is Anytrust Protocol \nThe AnyTrust protocol is a variation of the Arbitrum Nitro technology designed to reduce costs by incorporating a slight trust assumption. Instead of requiring every node within the Arbitrum network to have access to all Layer 2 transaction data—typically ensured by posting this data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust delegates this responsibility to a Data Availability Committee. This committee, comprising multiple members, operates under the assumption that at least two members are honest. Consequently, even if the majority collude, the integrity of data availability is maintained, allowing the rollup protocol to function correctly and reducing the reliance on Ethereum's more costly data posting process.\n\n### Benefits of AnyTrust\nThe benefits of AnyTrust are extensive including:\n\n#### 1. Cost Reduction \nThe AnyTrust protocol reduces costs on the Arbitrum system by entrusting a Committee with data storage and distribution, thus minimizing the data posted to Ethereum's mainnet. Through a managed system of public keys and signatures called Keysets, it ensures data integrity while lessening the gas fees typically incurred for data posting.\n\n#### 2. Operational Efficiency \nThe KeysetManager contract on L1 manages Keysets to facilitate secure and flexible operation of the Committee, allowing for easy updates to membership and keys. This ensures data availability and supports a trust-minimized, efficient blockchain ecosystem.",

          "details": "## The AnyTrust Security\nAnyTrust security harnesses a strategic balance between trust and decentralization, elevating the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup infrastructure. By forming a Data Availability Committee, AnyTrust fortifies data integrity and accessibility. It consists of the following components:\n\n### Data Availibility Committee\nThe Data Availability Committee is a specialized group within the AnyTrust protocol framework, tasked with the crucial role of storing and ensuring the accessibility of Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. This committee is comprised of multiple appointed members, operating under the fundamental assumption that at least two members are consistently honest and reliable. The integrity of the system hinges on this assumption, as it guarantees the availability of data, even in scenarios where other members may act maliciously or fail. \n\nThe committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public keys, known as Keysets, which establish the identity and authenticity of member signatures. These Keysets are dynamically manageable via a smart contract on Ethereum's Layer 1, known as the KeysetManager, which tracks and authenticates the current valid set of committee members. This arrangement not only ensures the security and availability of transaction data but also introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the dependency on Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and cost-effective rollup process.\n\n### Data Availibility Certificates\nThe Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is an essential component of the AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it. This evidence comprises the Keyset's hash used for signing, a bitmap of the signatories, and a collective BLS signature. Under AnyTrust’s trust model, a valid DACert guarantees that the data will be available from at least one trustworthy Committee member until the expiration time. \n\nIn contrast to the standard Nitro practice where sequencers post full data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust permits posting a DACert as a more gas-efficient alternative. The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset, while Layer 2 code performs additional checks on the signature and expiration time to ensure the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these checks, the associated data block is considered available, thereby optimizing the data posting process by reducing the on-chain footprint and maintaining data availability.\n\n### Data Availibility Server \nCommittee members in the AnyTrust protocol operate Data Availability Servers (DAS), which provide crucial infrastructure for data storage and retrieval. The DAS implements two distinct application programming interfaces (APIs):\n\n1. **Sequencer API:** This is a JSON-RPC interface exclusive to the Arbitrum chain's Sequencer, through which the Sequencer submits data blocks to be stored by the DAS. Access to this API is typically restricted to the Sequencer to prevent unauthorized submissions.\n\n2. **REST API:** Available publicly, this HTTP(S)-based RESTful API allows any participant to fetch data blocks using their hash. It is designed to be fully cacheable, and deployments often employ caching proxies or content delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and mitigate the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\nWhile the Sequencer API is essential only for Committee members, the REST API's functionality is often supported by other entities as well, contributing positively to the system's robustness. The DAS software itself is versatile, with configuration options that allow data to be stored in various ways—locally on file systems, within a Badger database across multiple backing stores for redundancy. Furthermore, the DAS includes features for enhanced performance and reliability, such as optional in-memory caching utilizing Bigcache or external caching with a Redis instance, catering to the diverse needs of data storage and access in the AnyTrust ecosystem. This multi-faceted approach ensures that data is not only stored securely but is also readily available for validation and use by the network, thus maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the Arbitrum protocol.",

          "details": "## Sequencer-Committee Interaction\nHere's the step-by-step process detailing the interaction between the Arbitrum sequencer and the Data Availability Committee during block validation in the Arbitrum AnyTrust protocol:\n\n### Step 1:Batch Creation\nThe Arbitrum sequencer generates a data batch for submission and sets an expiration time, typically three weeks ahead. The sequencer sends this batch data along with the expiration time to all Committee members simultaneously via an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface.\n\n### Step 2: Data Storage by Committee Members\nEach Committee member receives the batch and stores the data in its own backing store, using the data’s hash as an index for future retrieval. Committee members then sign the pair consisting of the data’s hash and the expiration time using their individual BLS cryptographic keys.\n\n### Step 3: DACert Creation\nThe Committee members send their signatures back to the sequencer. Each returns a signature accompanied by an indicator of successful storage. Once the sequencer receives the required number of signatures, it aggregates them to form a Data Availability Certificate (DACert) for the data batch.\n\n### Step 4: DACert Posting\nThe sequencer posts this DACert to the Layer 1 (L1) inbox contract. The DACert is now available for the AnyTrust Layer 2 (L2) chain software, which can validate the data's availability based on it. If the sequencer cannot obtain the necessary signatures within a specified time frame, it defaults to the traditional rollup method. It then posts the full data directly to the L1 chain, bypassing the Committee. The L2 software is designed to recognize both data formats—either provided through a DACert or posted in full. It processes the data accordingly to continue the chain’s operation seamlessly.\n\nThis process ensures that the AnyTrust protocol can validate blocks efficiently while offering a contingency plan to maintain the chain's integrity and continuity.",
