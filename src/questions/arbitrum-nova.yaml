    What is the role of the Data Availability Committee (DAC) in the AnyTrust
    protocol?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    The DAC has the task of efficiently handling Layer 2 transaction
    data—storing it, batching it, and then posting it to Ethereum's Layer 1.
    This allows Arbitrum Nova to offer enhanced performance and
    cost-effectiveness.

  content: What is the main benefit of the AnyTrust protocol?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    The AnyTrust protocol reduces costs on the Arbitrum system by entrusting a
    Committee with data storage and distribution, thus minimizing the data
    posted to Ethereum's mainnet. It also ensures data integrity while lessening
    the gas fees typically incurred for data posting.
