    What is the primary difference between Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge
    Rollups (ZK-Rollups)?
  hint: ''
  explanation: >-
    Optimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid unless challenged, while
    ZK-Rollups use a cryptographic proof (zk-SNARK or zk-STARK) to attest to
    their validity.
