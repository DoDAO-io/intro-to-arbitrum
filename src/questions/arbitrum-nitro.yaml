    What is a unique feature of Arbitrum Nitro compared to other layer 2
    solutions?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Arbitrum Nitro supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that
    existing Ethereum contracts and transactions can run on Arbitrum without any
    changes. This distinguishes Arbitrum Nitro from other layer 2 solutions as
    each have their own VMs thereby requiring modifications for integration.
