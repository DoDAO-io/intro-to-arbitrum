    ## Roll Ups

    Rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that execute transactions
    outside the main Ethereum chain (off-chain) but record transaction data on
    the main chain (on-chain). The core idea is to "roll up" or batch many
    transactions into a single one, which is then posted to the main chain. This
    reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed on the main
    chain, significantly increasing throughput and reducing transaction fees.


    ### Types of Roll ups

    There are two main types of rollups, each with its own approach to
    validating the batched transactions:


    #### Optimistic Rollups

    These operate on the principle that all transactions are assumed to be valid
    by default. They only execute transaction computations on-chain in the event
    of a challenge. This means that instead of performing computation to prove
    the correctness of transactions upfront, Optimistic Rollups post the
    transactions along with a bond. After a challenge period, if no one disputes
    the transaction batch with a "fraud proof" showing that something was wrong,
    the transactions are considered valid. This method allows for significant
    scaling benefits, but the challenge period can introduce a delay in
    finalizing transactions.


    #### Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)

    ZK-Rollups bundle transactions and generate a cryptographic proof, known as
    a zero-knowledge proof (specifically, a zk-SNARK or zk-STARK), attesting to
    their validity. This proof is then posted to the main chain, where it can be
    quickly verified. Because the validity of the entire batch can be confirmed
    without executing the transactions individually, ZK-Rollups can finalize
    transactions much more quickly than Optimistic Rollups. Additionally,
    ZK-Rollups enhance privacy since the actual transaction data can be kept
    off-chain.


    ## Optimistic Rollup; How it works?

    Optimistic Rollups operates on the assumption that all transactions are
    honest and valid unless proven otherwise. Here's how they work:


    #### Step 1: Execution and Aggregation

    In optimistic rollups, operators, or validators, process transactions by
    aggregating and compressing them before submitting them to Ethereum's
    blockchain. Any user can act as a validator by providing a bond, similar to
    proof-of-stake systems, and risks penalties for any invalid submissions.
    Validators also maintain their version of the rollup's state and can issue
    fraud proofs if discrepancies arise. Some rollups use a 'sequencer' instead
    of multiple validators, which centralizes transaction processing and
    submission but provides greater control over transaction order and immediate
    access to the rollup chain.


    #### Step 2: Sending Roll up Blocks to Ethereum

    Operators consolidate multiple off-chain transactions into a single batch
    and compress the transaction data to minimize storage costs on Ethereum.
    This batch is then submitted to Ethereum as 'calldata' — a temporary and
    immutable form of data used by smart contracts to execute functions. While
    'calldata' remains in the blockchain's history, it does not become part of
    the Ethereum state, thereby conserving space and reducing costs. The
    'calldata' keyword in Solidity is instrumental in calling smart contract
    functions and organizing inputs, playing a critical role in the efficient
    operation of optimistic rollups. 


    #### Step 3: State Commitments

    State commitments play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the
    system. The state is structured as a Merkle tree, also known as the state
    tree, which contains all the information about the current state of the
    rollup. Operators compute new state roots reflecting the latest state
    changes and submit these roots to the rollup contract on Ethereum. By
    committing to the old and new state roots when posting transaction batches,
    and including the Merkle root for transactions, operators provide a
    verifiable record of the rollup's state changes on the Layer 1 blockchain.
    This mechanism ensures that the state of the rollup can be trusted and
    verified.


    #### Step 4: Fraud Proof 

    The essence of optimistic rollups lies in their fraud-proof mechanism. They
    allow blocks to be published without immediate validity checks. If
    discrepancies are suspected, users can challenge transitions within a set
    timeframe. Challenges trigger fraud-proof calculations, where disputed
    transactions are replayed on Ethereum's main network through a verifier
    contract. If fraud is confirmed, the responsible validator is penalized. To
    support this, rollups must make detailed state commitments and transaction
    data public on-chain, which incurs gas fees. Multi-round interactive proofs
    can enhance this process's efficiency by reducing the data and computation
    required for each verification step.


    #### Step 5: Multiround Interactive Proving

    Multi-round interactive proving is a critical component of optimistic
    rollups. It involves a dialogue between a challenger and the block's
    producer (asserter/operator), overseen by a Layer 1 verifier contract. If a
    block is challenged, the operator splits the disputed assertion for the
    rollup block into two, with each part undergoing repeated division through a
    bisection protocol until the specific point of contention is isolated. The
    verifier contract then adjudicates the dispute and identifies any fraudulent
    activity. This process ensures that only valid transactions are finalized,
    with the capability to penalize malicious actors, thereby maintaining the
    integrity of the rollup.

    Arbitrum ecosystem consists of various chains with distinct features that
    utilise unique technologies that enable ethereum scalability. The major
    arbitrum chains include.


    ### Arbitrum One

    Arbitrum One is a Layer 2 optimistic rollup solution that enhances Ethereum
    blockchain. It doesn't require any additional trust beyond that which is
    inherent to Ethereum's Layer 1. Enabled by the Nitro technology stack,
    Arbitrum One features efficient data handling and execution, improved
    transaction compression, and compatibility with Ethereum's gas system,
    streamlining the process while keeping security tight.


    ### Arbitrum Nova

    Arbitrum Nova is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed for high performance
    and cost efficiency. It operates on the AnyTrust protocol, which is a
    slightly less trustless system compared to Arbitrum One's Rollup protocol.
    The primary distinction lies in the AnyTrust protocol's reliance on a Data
    Availability Committee (DAC) to manage transaction data. This committee
    ensures the speedy and efficient handling of Level 2 transaction data before
    it is finalized on Ethereum's main chain. Arbitrum Nova is tailored for
    applications where high throughput and affordability are prioritized.


    ### Arbitrum Orbit

    Arbitrum Orbit allows the creation of personalized chains that settle
    transactions to Arbitrum's Layer 2 chains, such as Arbitrum One or Arbitrum
    Nova. You have full control over your Orbit chain, with the ability to
    tailor its privacy settings, permissions, governance structure, and fee
    token according to your specific requirements. Orbit chains can be as open
    or restricted as you prefer, offering a customizable path to
    decentralization and the option to integrate ongoing enhancements from the
    Arbitrum Nitro technology stack


    ## How is arbiturm diferent from other Optimistic L2 Rollups?

    Arbitrum's approach prioritizes a balance of speed, cost, security, and
    developer accessibility, underpinning its leading market position. Some of
    the major differences include:


    ### Fraud Proofs

    Arbitrum sets itself apart from other Optimistic L2 Rollups primarily
    through its multi-round fraud proof system, which contrasts with
    single-round fraud proofs used by platforms like Optimism. This system
    verifies only challenged transactions, which may result in lower fees due to
    decreased reliance on Layer 1 computations.


    ### Virtual Machine Compatibility

    The Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM) is more closely optimized for EVM coding
    languages, making it developer-friendly as applications don't need to be
    rewritten to transition from the EVM to the AVM. This contrasts with
    Optimism's Virtual Machine (OVM), which has faced some compatibility issues
    with the EVM.


    ### Transaction Finality and Fees

    Due to the multi-round fraud proof mechanism, transaction finality on
    Arbitrum can be slower compared to some other rollups, but this trade-off
    allows for lower fees because of reduced Layer 1 computation reliance​.
