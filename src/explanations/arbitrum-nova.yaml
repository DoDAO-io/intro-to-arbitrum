    ## The AnyTrust Security

    AnyTrust security harnesses a strategic balance between trust and
    decentralization, elevating the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup
    infrastructure. By forming a Data Availability Committee, AnyTrust fortifies
    data integrity and accessibility. It consists of the following components:


    ### Data Availibility Committee

    The Data Availability Committee is a specialized group within the AnyTrust
    protocol framework, tasked with the crucial role of storing and ensuring the
    accessibility of Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. This
    committee is comprised of multiple appointed members, operating under the
    fundamental assumption that at least two members are consistently honest and
    reliable. The integrity of the system hinges on this assumption, as it
    guarantees the availability of data, even in scenarios where other members
    may act maliciously or fail. 


    The committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public keys,
    known as Keysets, which establish the identity and authenticity of member
    signatures. These Keysets are dynamically manageable via a smart contract on
    Ethereum's Layer 1, known as the KeysetManager, which tracks and
    authenticates the current valid set of committee members. This arrangement
    not only ensures the security and availability of transaction data but also
    introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the dependency on
    Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and cost-effective rollup
    process.


    ### Data Availibility Certificates

    The Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is an essential component of the
    AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A
    DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic
    evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it. This evidence
    comprises the Keyset's hash used for signing, a bitmap of the signatories,
    and a collective BLS signature. Under AnyTrust’s trust model, a valid DACert
    guarantees that the data will be available from at least one trustworthy
    Committee member until the expiration time. 


    In contrast to the standard Nitro practice where sequencers post full data
    on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust permits posting a DACert as a more
    gas-efficient alternative. The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset,
    while Layer 2 code performs additional checks on the signature and
    expiration time to ensure the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these
    checks, the associated data block is considered available, thereby
    optimizing the data posting process by reducing the on-chain footprint and
    maintaining data availability.


    ### Data Availibility Server 

    Committee members in the AnyTrust protocol operate Data Availability Servers
    (DAS), which provide crucial infrastructure for data storage and retrieval.
    The DAS implements two distinct application programming interfaces (APIs):


    1. **Sequencer API:** This is a JSON-RPC interface exclusive to the Arbitrum
    chain's Sequencer, through which the Sequencer submits data blocks to be
    stored by the DAS. Access to this API is typically restricted to the
    Sequencer to prevent unauthorized submissions.


    2. **REST API:** Available publicly, this HTTP(S)-based RESTful API allows
    any participant to fetch data blocks using their hash. It is designed to be
    fully cacheable, and deployments often employ caching proxies or content
    delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and mitigate the risk of
    denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.


    While the Sequencer API is essential only for Committee members, the REST
    API's functionality is often supported by other entities as well,
    contributing positively to the system's robustness. The DAS software itself
    is versatile, with configuration options that allow data to be stored in
    various ways—locally on file systems, within a Badger database across
    multiple backing stores for redundancy. Furthermore, the DAS includes
    features for enhanced performance and reliability, such as optional
    in-memory caching utilizing Bigcache or external caching with a Redis
    instance, catering to the diverse needs of data storage and access in the
    AnyTrust ecosystem. This multi-faceted approach ensures that data is not
    only stored securely but is also readily available for validation and use by
    the network, thus maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the Arbitrum
    protocol.

    ## Sequencer-Committee Interaction

    Here's the step-by-step process detailing the interaction between the
    Arbitrum sequencer and the Data Availability Committee during block
    validation in the Arbitrum AnyTrust protocol:


    ### Step 1:Batch Creation

    The Arbitrum sequencer generates a data batch for submission and sets an
    expiration time, typically three weeks ahead. The sequencer sends this batch
    data along with the expiration time to all Committee members simultaneously
    via an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface.


    ### Step 2: Data Storage by Committee Members

    Each Committee member receives the batch and stores the data in its own
    backing store, using the data’s hash as an index for future retrieval.
    Committee members then sign the pair consisting of the data’s hash and the
    expiration time using their individual BLS cryptographic keys.


    ### Step 3: DACert Creation

    The Committee members send their signatures back to the sequencer. Each
    returns a signature accompanied by an indicator of successful storage. Once
    the sequencer receives the required number of signatures, it aggregates them
    to form a Data Availability Certificate (DACert) for the data batch.


    ### Step 4: DACert Posting

    The sequencer posts this DACert to the Layer 1 (L1) inbox contract. The
    DACert is now available for the AnyTrust Layer 2 (L2) chain software, which
    can validate the data's availability based on it. If the sequencer cannot
    obtain the necessary signatures within a specified time frame, it defaults
    to the traditional rollup method. It then posts the full data directly to
    the L1 chain, bypassing the Committee. The L2 software is designed to
    recognize both data formats—either provided through a DACert or posted in
    full. It processes the data accordingly to continue the chain’s operation
    seamlessly.


    This process ensures that the AnyTrust protocol can validate blocks
    efficiently while offering a contingency plan to maintain the chain's
    integrity and continuity.
