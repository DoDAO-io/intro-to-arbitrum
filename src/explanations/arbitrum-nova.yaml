    ## The AnyTrust Security

    AnyTrust security harnesses a strategic balance between trust and
    decentralization, elevating the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup
    infrastructure. By forming a Data Availability Committee, AnyTrust fortifies
    data integrity and accessibility. It consists of the following components:


    ### Data Availibility Committee

    The Data Availability Committee is a specialized group within the AnyTrust
    protocol framework, tasked with the crucial role of storing and ensuring the
    accessibility of Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. This
    committee is comprised of multiple appointed members, operating under the
    fundamental assumption that at least two members are consistently honest and
    reliable. The integrity of the system hinges on this assumption, as it
    guarantees the availability of data, even in scenarios where other members
    may act maliciously or fail. 


    The committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public keys,
    known as Keysets, which establish the identity and authenticity of member
    signatures. These Keysets are dynamically manageable via a smart contract on
    Ethereum's Layer 1, known as the KeysetManager, which tracks and
    authenticates the current valid set of committee members. This arrangement
    not only ensures the security and availability of transaction data but also
    introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the dependency on
    Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and cost-effective rollup
    process.


    ### Data Availibility Certificates

    The Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is an essential component of the
    AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A
    DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic
    evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it. This evidence
    comprises the Keyset's hash used for signing, a bitmap of the signatories,
    and a collective BLS signature. Under AnyTrust’s trust model, a valid DACert
    guarantees that the data will be available from at least one trustworthy
    Committee member until the expiration time. 


    In contrast to the standard Nitro practice where sequencers post full data
    on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust permits posting a DACert as a more
    gas-efficient alternative. The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset,
    while Layer 2 code performs additional checks on the signature and
    expiration time to ensure the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these
    checks, the associated data block is considered available, thereby
    optimizing the data posting process by reducing the on-chain footprint and
    maintaining data availability.


    ### Data Availibility Server 

    Committee members in the AnyTrust protocol operate Data Availability Servers
    (DAS), which provide crucial infrastructure for data storage and retrieval.
    The DAS implements two distinct application programming interfaces (APIs):


    1. **Sequencer API:** This is a JSON-RPC interface exclusive to the Arbitrum
    chain's Sequencer, through which the Sequencer submits data blocks to be
    stored by the DAS. Access to this API is typically restricted to the
    Sequencer to prevent unauthorized submissions.


    2. **REST API:** Available publicly, this HTTP(S)-based RESTful API allows
    any participant to fetch data blocks using their hash. It is designed to be
    fully cacheable, and deployments often employ caching proxies or content
    delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and mitigate the risk of
    denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.


    While the Sequencer API is essential only for Committee members, the REST
    API's functionality is often supported by other entities as well,
    contributing positively to the system's robustness. The DAS software itself
    is versatile, with configuration options that allow data to be stored in
    various ways—locally on file systems, within a Badger database across
    multiple backing stores for redundancy. Furthermore, the DAS includes
    features for enhanced performance and reliability, such as optional
    in-memory caching utilizing Bigcache or external caching with a Redis
    instance, catering to the diverse needs of data storage and access in the
    AnyTrust ecosystem. This multi-faceted approach ensures that data is not
    only stored securely but is also readily available for validation and use by
    the network, thus maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the Arbitrum
    protocol.
