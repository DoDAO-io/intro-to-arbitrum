      ## What is Arbitrum


      Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum
      blockchain's scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions
      separately from Ethereum's main chain and utilizes Rollup technology to
      combine multiple transactions into one, increasing throughput and reducing
      costs. Arbitrum maintains compatibility with Ethereum's existing tools and
      smart contracts, allowing for straightforward application deployment.
      Developed by Offchain Labs, it includes the Arbitrum One mainnet, which
      supports smart contract execution with Ethereum network validation. The
      use of Arbitrum significantly lowers transaction fees, making it a
      cost-effective alternative for running decentralized applications and
      smart contracts compared to Ethereum's mainnet.


      ## What is Layer 2 


      Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top
      of an existing blockchain system, known as Layer 1. The primary purpose of
      Layer 2 solutions is to address the scalability and performance issues of
      the main blockchain by handling transactions off the main chain. This
      allows for faster processing times and reduced transaction costs, without
      compromising the decentralized security model of the underlying
      blockchain. Layer 2 solutions include various technologies such as state
      channels, sidechains, and rollups, each with their own approach to
      off-chain transaction handling and subsequently settling the final state
      on-chain.


      ## Benefits of Layer 2


      1. **Increased Transaction:** Throughput By handling transactions off the
      main chain, Layer 2 can process many more transactions per second than the
      base layer, alleviating congestion.


      2. **Reduced Costs:** Transactions on Layer 2 typically incur lower fees
      because they minimize the demand on the network's main chain resources.


      3. **Improved Speed:** Transactions can be completed faster on Layer 2, as
      they are not subject to the longer processing times of the main chain.


      4. **Enhanced Scalability:** Layer 2 can scale independently from the main
      chain, allowing the network to support more users and applications without
      a proportional increase in transaction costs or times.


      5. **Maintained Security:** Despite processing transactions off-chain,
      Layer 2 solutions typically inherit the strong security guarantees of the
      underlying main chain.
