      ## What is Arbitrum


      Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum
      blockchain's scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions
      separately from Ethereum's main chain and utilizes Rollup technology to
      combine multiple transactions into one, increasing throughput and reducing
      costs. Arbitrum maintains compatibility with Ethereum's existing tools and
      smart contracts, allowing for straightforward application deployment.
      Developed by Offchain Labs, it includes the Arbitrum One mainnet, which
      supports smart contract execution with Ethereum network validation. The
      use of Arbitrum significantly lowers transaction fees, making it a
      cost-effective alternative for running decentralized applications and
      smart contracts compared to Ethereum's mainnet.


      ## What is Layer 2 


      Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top
      of an existing blockchain system, known as Layer 1. The primary purpose of
      Layer 2 solutions is to address the scalability and performance issues of
      the main blockchain by handling transactions off the main chain. This
      allows for faster processing times and reduced transaction costs, without
      compromising the decentralized security model of the underlying
      blockchain. Layer 2 solutions include various technologies such as state
      channels, sidechains, and rollups, each with their own approach to
      off-chain transaction handling and subsequently settling the final state
      on-chain.


      ## Benefits of Layer 2


      1. **Increased Transaction:** Throughput By handling transactions off the
      main chain, Layer 2 can process many more transactions per second than the
      base layer, alleviating congestion.


      2. **Reduced Costs:** Transactions on Layer 2 typically incur lower fees
      because they minimize the demand on the network's main chain resources.


      3. **Improved Speed:** Transactions can be completed faster on Layer 2, as
      they are not subject to the longer processing times of the main chain.


      4. **Enhanced Scalability:** Layer 2 can scale independently from the main
      chain, allowing the network to support more users and applications without
      a proportional increase in transaction costs or times.


      5. **Maintained Security:** Despite processing transactions off-chain,
      Layer 2 solutions typically inherit the strong security guarantees of the
      underlying main chain.

      ## What is Arbitrum Nitro?


      Arbitrum Nitro is a significant technical upgrade for Arbitrum, which is a
      Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to lower transaction fees
      and increase the processing capacity of Ethereum by moving contract
      computation and storage from the primary chain. This upgrade, known as
      Nitro, is designed to be more compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine
      (EVM) and provides a better user experience with lower fees and faster
      transactions. With Nitro, Arbitrum aims to push the boundaries of
      security, efficiency, and scalability, offering a promising solution for
      the future of Ethereum. 


      It introduces advanced calldata compression, reducing transaction costs
      even further. Nitro enhances the performance of Layer 1 (L1) nodes, aligns
      EVM operation pricing with Ethereum, and introduces additional
      synchronization with Ethereum L1 blocks. As it seamlessly supports the
      Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), no hefty modifications are required. With
      Nitro, transactions on Arbitrum have become extremely efficient. 


      ## Innovative Features of Arbitrum Nitro


      #### WebAssembly Code


      Nitro introduces a new prover that uses WebAssembly (WASM) code to perform
      Arbitrum's interactive fraud proofs. This upgrade enhances the scalability
      and efficiency of the system, allowing for thousands of transactions to be
      processed per second. Despite being a separate blockchain, Arbitrum Nitro
      maintains the security and privacy features of Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) and
      relays all transaction information to the main Ethereum chain.


      #### EVM Compatiblility


      Developers can easily integrate Arbitrum Nitro without making any
      modifications because it supports the EVM. This means that existing
      Ethereum contracts and transactions can run on Arbitrum without any
      changes. This distinguishes Arbitrum Nitro from other layer 2 solutions as
      each have their own VMs thereby requiring modifications for integration. 


      #### Deterministic Transactions


      To use Arbitrum Nitro, users need to submit their transactions to the
      chain's inbox. The chain will then execute the transaction and produce
      outputs, including a transaction receipt and any initiated withdrawals.
      The execution of transactions is deterministic, meaning that the result is
      known as soon as the transaction is placed in the inbox. Arbitrum ensures
      the correctness of the chain state and outputs, supports
      Ethereum-compatible contracts and transactions, and manages the transfer
      and management of ETH and tokens on the chain.
